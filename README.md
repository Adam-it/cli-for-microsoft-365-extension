## âœ¨ Features

### Script samples gallery

Using `CLI M365: Open samples gallery` command or 'Samples' button you may open the gallery with all available samples. Currently, the samples shown are retrieved from the [PnP script samples repository](https://github.com/pnp/script-samples). From the samples gallery you may go to the sample location or create a new tab in the editor prefilled with the CLI for Microsoft 365 script. It is possible to search for samples by:

- title
- authors
- commands used in samples
